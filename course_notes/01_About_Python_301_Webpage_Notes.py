""" About Python 301 Webpage Notes 
    -> outline
        -> Python 301 is the third and final module in the Python Programming Series
            -> follows Python 101 (Introduction to Programming)
            -> follows Python 201 (Procedural Python)
            -> completes the foundational training in Python
        -> focuses on object-oriented programming (OOP)
            -> a paradigm built around the use of "objects" — data + behavior combined
            -> uses classes to define how data and methods interact
        -> purpose of this module
            -> to bridge the gap between procedural programming (step-by-step) and object-oriented design
            -> to help learners write scalable, reusable, and modular Python programs
        -> serves as a prerequisite for advanced career tracks
            -> Data Science & Machine Learning
            -> Deep Learning & Neural Networks
            -> Django Web Framework (backend web development)
            -> Flask Web Framework (lightweight web apps)
        -> by the end, learners are prepared for advanced, real-world Python applications

    -> course progression
        -> Python 101
            -> focuses on Python syntax, logic, and problem-solving basics
        -> Python 201
            -> expands into procedural programming and modular thinking
        -> Python 301
            -> introduces OOP (object-oriented programming)
            -> focuses on building complex applications with reusable structures
        -> acts as a transition from writing scripts to designing software systems
        -> includes real-world practices such as testing, debugging, and error handling

    -> what you will learn
        -> object-oriented programming concepts
            -> understanding the difference between classes and objects
                -> class: blueprint or template
                -> object: instance created from that blueprint
            -> learning how to design Python classes properly
                -> attributes: represent data stored in an object
                -> methods: represent behaviors (functions within a class)
        -> using `self`
            -> represents the current instance of a class
            -> used to access instance attributes and methods
            -> ensures that data stays bound to specific objects
        -> dunder (double underscore) methods
            -> also known as magic or special methods
            -> examples: `__init__`, `__str__`, `__len__`, `__eq__`, etc.
            -> used to make classes behave like built-in Python types
                -> e.g., overloading `+` or `==` operators
        -> inheritance
            -> mechanism for code reuse
            -> allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes
            -> supports the creation of subclass hierarchies
                -> parent (base) classes and child (derived) classes
        -> composition
            -> an alternative to inheritance
            -> involves combining smaller, reusable components
            -> "has-a" relationship rather than "is-a"
            -> example: A `Car` has an `Engine`, but is not a type of engine
        -> exception handling
            -> handling runtime errors gracefully using `try`, `except`, `finally`
            -> defining custom exceptions for specific use cases
        -> unit testing
            -> using Python’s built-in `unittest` framework
            -> writing automated tests to verify code functionality
            -> following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach
        -> decorators
            -> functions that modify or enhance other functions
            -> common in frameworks and for adding functionality dynamically
        -> abstract and idiomatic data structures
            -> abstract structures: stacks, queues, linked lists
            -> idiomatic: Pythonic patterns using lists, sets, dicts, tuples
        -> web scraping
            -> introduction to extracting data from web pages using Python
            -> may involve libraries like BeautifulSoup or requests
        -> capstone project
            -> combines all skills from 101, 201, and 301
            -> builds a larger-scale OOP application from scratch
            -> demonstrates ability to structure and design software using OOP
